# Famous Natural Experiments

- **Oregon Health Insurance Experiment**: Oregon used lottery to grant Medicare access to 10,000 people, showing access to Medicaid increased use of health services, lowered debt, etc. relative to those not on Medicaid
- **Angrist (1990)** finds that lifetime earnings of (random) drafted Vietnam veterans is 15% lower than non-veterans
- **Card & Kreuger (1994)** find that minimum wage hike in fast-food restaurants on NJ side of border had no disemployment effects relative to restaurants on PA side of border during the same period
- **Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001)** find that inclusive institutions lead to higher economic development than extractive institutions, determined by a colony's disease environment in 1500
- We will look at some of these in greater detail throughout the course
