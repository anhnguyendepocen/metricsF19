<p><strong>The exact number and type of questions may change.</strong> Note both the concepts study guide and the</p>
<p><strong>You may not have anything with you</strong> for the exam (no notes, etc) <strong>except a calculator.</strong> I write questions such that you can get a perfect score without a calculator, and answers should typically be simple whole numbers. However, I understand that if nothing else, calculators are moral support and you can use them. I will provide simple calculators if you need to borrow one, as well as extra paper.</p>
<p><strong>There will be no use of R on the exam</strong>. However, you <em>should</em> be familiar with certain outputs of R that I can ask you questions about (such as regression output from <code>lm()</code>).</p>
<p><strong>There will be few, if any, calculation questions</strong>. Questions are more about <em>interpretation</em> of concepts and interpretting numbers in the context of various regressions and research questions.</p>
<p>Students that require accommodations and students that know they will be absent must confirm with me any arrangements at least a week <em>in advance</em> of the Exam.</p>
<h2 id="my-advice">My Advice</h2>
<p>Make sure you do all of the homework problems and learn from the answer keys to the homeworks, as well as the in-class practice problems. While some of the questions should be novel applications, conceptual questions on homeworks will get you in the right headspace to think about answering a question on an exam.</p>
