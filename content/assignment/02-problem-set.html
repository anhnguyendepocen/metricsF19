<p>For this problem set, you may type up your answers to each question (save plots as images and include them with your answers) and also turn in a (commented!) <em>.R</em> file of commands for each relevant question. You may email or turn in a paper copy. It is not relevant for this particular problem set, but in the future, I will allow handwritten answers for math/theory questions.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may download the <code>.Rmd</code> file, do the homework in markdown, and email to me a single <code>knit</code>ted <code>html</code> or <code>pdf</code> file (and be sure that it shows all of your code).</p>
<p>To minimize confusion, I suggest creating a new <code>R Project</code> (e.g.Â <code>hw1</code>) and storing any data and plots in that folder on your computer. See my <a href="https://github.com/ryansafner/workflow">example workflow</a>.</p>
<p>You may work together (and I highly encourage that) but you must turn in your own answers. I grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, pick one question to grade for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately.</p>

<p>In your own words, explain what (sample) standard deviation <em>means</em>.</p>
<h4 id="b.">b.</h4>
<p>In your own words, explain how (sample) standard deviation is calculated. You may also write the formula, but it is not necessary.</p>
