<p>Before we begin, start a new file with <code>File</code> <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <code>New File</code> <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <code>R Script</code>. As you work through this sheet in the console in <code>R</code>, also add (copy/paste) your commands that work into this new file. At the end, save it, and run to execute all of your commands at once.</p>
<h2 id="creating-objects">Creating Objects</h2>
<h3 id="section">1.</h3>
<p>a. Create a vector called <code>me</code> with two objects, your first name, and your last name.
b. Call the vector to inspect it.
c. Confirm it is a character class vector.</p>

<h3 id="execute-your-r-script">Execute your R Script</h3>
<p>Save the R Script you created at the beginning and (hopefully) have been pasting all of your valid commands to. This creates a <em>.R</em> file wherever you choose to save it to. Now looking at the file in the upper left pane of <em>R Studio</em> look for the button in the upper right corner that says <strong>Run</strong>. Sit back and watch <code>R</code> redo everything you’ve carefully worked on, all at once.</p>
