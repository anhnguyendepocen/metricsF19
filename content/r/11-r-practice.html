<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/congress-trump-score">data</a> comes from fivethirtyeight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/">Trump Congress tracker</a>.</p>

<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>
<p>Download and read in (<code>read_csv</code>) the data.</p>

<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>
<p>Look at the data with <code>glimpse()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="question-3">Question 3</h3>
<p>We want to see <em>how does the percentage that a member of Congress’ agrees with President Trump (<code>agree_pct</code>) depend on the result of the 2016 Presidential election in their district (<code>net_trump_vote</code>)</em>? First, plot a scatterplot of <code>agree_pct</code> on <code>net_trump_vote</code>. Add a regression line with an additional layer of <code>geom_smooth(method="lm")</code>.</p>
<h3 id="question-4">Question 4</h3>
<p>Find the correlation between <code>agree_pct</code> and <code>net_trump_vote</code>.</p>
<h3 id="question-5">Question 5</h3>
<p>We weant to predict the following model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\widehat{\text{agree_pct}}= \hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}\text{net_trump_vote}\]</span></p>
<p>Run a regression, and save it as an object. Now get a <code>summary()</code> of it.</p>
<h4 id="part-a">Part A</h4>
<p>What is <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta_0}\)</span>? What does it mean in the context of our question?</p>
<h4 id="part-b">Part B</h4>
<p>What is <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta_1}\)</span>? What does it mean in the context of our question?</p>
<h4 id="part-c">Part C</h4>
<p>What is <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>? What does it mean?</p>
<h4 id="part-d">Part D</h4>
<p>What is the <span class="math inline">\(SER\)</span>? What does it mean?</p>
<h3 id="question-6">Question 6</h3>
<p>We can look at regression outputs in a tidier way, with the <code>broom</code> package.</p>
<h4 id="part-a-1">Part A</h4>
<p>Install and then load <code>broom</code>.</p>
<h4 id="part-b-1">Part B</h4>
<p>Run the function <code>tidy()</code> on your regression object (saved in question 5). Save this as an object and then look at it.</p>
<h4 id="part-c-1">Part C</h4>
<p>Run the <code>glance()</code> function on your original regression object. What does it show you?</p>
<h4 id="part-d-1">Part D</h4>
<p>Now run the <code>augment()</code> function on your original regression object, and save this as an object. Look at it. What does it show you?</p>
<h3 id="question-7">Question 7</h3>
<p>Now let’s start looking at the residuals of the regression.</p>
<h4 id="part-a-2">Part A</h4>
<p>Take the augmented regression object from Question 6-D and use it as the source of your data to create a histogram, where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is <code>.resid</code>. Does it look roughly normal?</p>
<h4 id="part-b-2">Part B</h4>
<p>Take the augmented regression object and make a residual plot, which is a scatterplot where <code>x</code> is the normal <code>x</code> variable, and <code>y</code> is the <code>.resid</code>. Feel free to add a horizontal line at 0 with <code>geom_hline(yintercept=0)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="question-8">Question 8</h3>
<p>Now let’s try presenting your results in a regression table. Install and load <code>huxtable</code>, and run the <code>huxreg()</code> command. Your main input is your regression object you saved in Question 5. Feel free to customize the output of this table (see the slides).</p>
<h3 id="question-9">Question 9</h3>
<p>Now let’s check for heteroskedasticity.</p>
<h4 id="part-a-3">Part A</h4>
<p>Looking at the scatterplot and residual plots in Questions 3 and 7B, do you think the errors are heteroskedastic or homoskedastic?</p>
<h4 id="part-b-3">Part B</h4>
<p>Install and load the <code>lmtest</code> package and run <code>bptest</code> on your regression object. Was the data heteroskedastic or homoskedastic?</p>
<h4 id="part-c-2">Part C</h4>
<p>Now let’s make some heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. Install and load the <code>estimatr</code> package and use the <code>lm_robust()</code> command (instead of the <code>lm()</code> command) to run a new regression (and save it). Make sure you add <code>se_type="stata"</code> inside the command to calculate robust SEs. Look at it. What changes?</p>
<h4 id="part-d-2">Part D</h4>
<p>Now let’s see this in a nice regression table. Use <code>huxreg()</code> again, but add both your original regression and your regression saved in part C. Notice any changes?</p>
<h3 id="question-10">Question 10</h3>
<p>Now let’s check for outliers.</p>
<h4 id="part-a-4">Part A</h4>
<p>Just looking at the scatterplot in Question 3, do you see any outliers?</p>
<h4 id="part-b-4">Part B</h4>
<p>Install and load the <code>car</code> package. Run the <code>outlierTest</code> command on your regression object. Does it detect any outliers?</p>
<h4 id="part-c-3">Part C</h4>
<p>Look in your original data to match this outlier with an observation. Hint: use the <code>slice()</code> command, as the outlier test gave you an observation number!</p>
<h3 id="question-11-optional">Question 11 (Optional)</h3>
<p>This data is still a bit messy. We’d also probably like to plot our scatterplots with colors for Republican and Democratic party. Or sort by the House and the Senate.</p>
