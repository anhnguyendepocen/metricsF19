Bailey dives right in with the basic linear regression model

$$Y=\beta_0+\beta_1 X$$

and also begins with some demonstrations of the model. Don't worry about this just yet. What is more important right now is the **identification problem** (*endogeneity*) and the **inference problem** (*randomness*) and how these challenges motivate a lot of what we are going to do.
