# Overview

Today we return to a more nuanced discussion of causality, given what we now know about multivariate regression. We also introduce a new tool for thinking about simple causal models, the **directed acyclic graph (DAG)*. These are a hip new trend for thinking about causal inference, so new and trendy that they aren't really in any mainstream textbooks yet!

# New Packages Mentioned

- `ggdag`: for drawing DAGs in `ggplot`
- [`dagitty.net`](http://dagitty.net): not a package in R, but an online tool to help you work with DAGs (see the cheat sheets in today's [readings page](/reading/17-reading))
