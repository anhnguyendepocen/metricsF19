<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This week we will cover non-linear models, which we anticipated last week with an interaction effect between two continuous variables: <span class="math inline">\(X_1 \times X_2\)</span>, where the marginal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_1 \rightarrow Y\)</span> is dependent on the value of <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We cover two types of nonlinear models. <em>Today</em>, we cover <strong>polynomial models</strong>, where we include higher-order <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> variables to explain a non-linear effect. <em>Next</em> class we will cover <strong>logarithmic models</strong>, which are more frequently used - as well as a few final tests and transformations for multivariate regression before we turn to panel data.</p>
<p>Today, we will spend the first half of class finishing <a href="/practice/19-r-practice">last class’ practice problems</a> (on dummy variables and interaction effects), then I will cover polynomial models. After we finish next class’ lecture, we will do another set of R practice problems, and you will be given <strong>HW 5</strong> to work on this material.</p>
