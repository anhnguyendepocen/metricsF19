# Overview

We may spend at maximum 10 minutes at the beginning of class continuing to work on last class' R practice questions. I will put up the answer key after class. Today we start the fun stuff - data visualization. We will cover how to build plots with the package `ggplot2` (part of the `tidyverse`): I will lecture for the first half (again, it will be a lot of information that you can refer back to as needed over the semester) and you will practice making plots.
