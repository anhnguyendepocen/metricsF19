# Overview

Today I will give you about half the class period to finish your practice problems and I can answer questions.   

# Knitting on Trading Room Computers

Last year, IT and I were unable to get the Trading Room computers to knit to pdf. I may have a workaround. We will install a minimal version of $\LaTeX{}$ inside of R Studio. Run the following code:

```{r, eval=F}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Then make a new `.Rmd` and try to `knit` it to `pdf`. It may install several packages (`knitr` and `rmarkdown` at least) and ask you a few prompts. It should then work.
